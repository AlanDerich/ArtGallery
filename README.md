# ArtGallery
This is a simple art gallery application. 
It displays some of my images and shows a description of the year the picture was taken and the photographer. 
It has 2 buttons that you can use to navigate to the next and previous button. 
It shows the fundamentals that I have learnt from developers.android.com 
i.e, (Box, Column and Row composables), (Text, Image, Buttons), state hoisting, lambda expressions, e.t.c
